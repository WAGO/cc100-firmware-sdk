# CC100 stores in EEPROM the two-point calibration data of its analog IOs.
# This script forms the data upon a pattern well known to the BSP customer.
# The formated data is then stored in a file $CALIB. Thus the structure of
# that file must not be changed:
#
# 1st line contains an ordered list of available analog channels.
# Other lines contain calibration points P1(x1 y1) and P2(x2 y2).
# And each line correlates with one channel and vice versa.
# e.g. 2nd line contains data of 1st channel
#      3rd line contains data of 2nd channel and so on.

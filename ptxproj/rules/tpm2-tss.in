	  TPM2 Software stack library - TSS and TCTI libraries

	  TPM2.0 TSS (Software Stack) consists of API layers provided
	  to support TPM 2.0 chips. It is made out of three layers:

	  * System API (SAPI), which implements the system layer API;
	  * TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI), which is used
	    by SAPI to allow communication with the TAB/RM layer;
	  * Trusted Access Broker/Resource Manager (TAB/RM), which
	    handles TPM resources and process coordination.

	  This package contains the TSS and TCTI libraries that client
	  applications will link against when they require accessing
	  the TPM.

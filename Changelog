Firmware Release 04.02.13 (24)

System:
[FIXED] Fixed a problem related to the dnsmasq DHCP server that resulted in
        no connection over USB when using a cloned SD card.

Runtime System:
[FIXED] “PLC load watchdog” might not work as espected: the plc load watchdog
        will detect (e.g. an endless loop) but the IEC task might not be stopped
        in any case. This might lead to a complete stop of the runtime process.
        As workaround and improve “hardening” of your IEC application we recommend
        to use an IEC Task watchdog on all your relevant IEC tasks in your IEC
        application.
[FIXED] CC100: Process image values in first cycle after power off / on.
[FIXED] CC100: Output stateLED and controlbyte differs.

Web Based Management:
[FIXED] In WBM it is not possible to start a restore of the system package if the
        device has booted from the memory card.

Firmware Release 04.01.10 (23)

System:
[FIXED] Backup&Restore: Backups created via the WBM can be used for restore.
[FIXED] Firewall: Added option in WBM/Interface configuration to disable IO Check.
[FIXED] Sporadic exception in Codesys application / IoDrvDal fixed.
[FIXED] Restarts caused by multiple actuation of the operating mode switch fixed.

Runtime System:
[KNOWN] “PLC load watchdog” might not work as espected: the plc load watchdog will
        detect (e.g. an endless loop) but the IEC task might not be stopped in any
        case. This might lead to a complete stop of the runtime process. As
        workaround and improve “hardening” of your IEC application we recommend
        to use an IEC Task watchdog on all your relevant IEC tasks in your IEC application.
